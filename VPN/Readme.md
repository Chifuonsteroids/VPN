This is a Python code for a simple TCP server that listens for incoming connections and handles them in separate threads. The server listens on the specified host and port using the TCP/IP protocol. When a client connects, the server accepts the connection, creates a new thread to handle the connection, and then waits for more connections.

The handle_client_connection function is responsible for handling each client connection. It receives a client socket object as an argument and reads data from the socket using the recv method. It then processes the request and sends a response back to the client using the send method. Finally, it closes the socket.

The main loop of the server waits for incoming connections using the accept method of the socket object. When a connection is accepted, it creates a new thread to handle the connection and starts the thread. The server continues to listen for more connections in the main thread.

Note that the server is not designed to handle multiple simultaneous connections efficiently. It creates a new thread for each connection, which can become a performance bottleneck if many clients connect at the same time. To handle multiple connections efficiently, you could use a thread pool or an asynchronous I/O library such as asyncio.
